# Hotel
## TODO
- [X] Walls & Floors
- [X] Add Furniture system
- [X] Multi-tile furniture support
- [X] Fix kinda buggy Y-sort for large furnis
- [X] Variations (clicking twice)
	- Pay attention to animation modes
		- Case in point: `Kitchen_sink_0_A` and `Kitchen_sink_0_B`
		- Variations will be like rotating between different SpriteSheets.
	- Pay attention to rotation (and things that cant or shouldn't be rotated, like wall stuff)
- [...] UI + Better controls and handling (BIG FEATURE)
	- Closer to habbo! But better. Will need to find assets.
	- [X] Basic dock with buttons.
	- [...] Inventory
		- [X] Should show preview of all items.
		- [X] For now, we should have 99 instances of each type of item.
		- [...] Deduct items when placing 
	- [ ] Interaction Modes (start top to bottom for ease)
		- [ ] Place: Triggered either from inventory or from clicking "move" on a furni from Select mode.
			- Build mode: Inventory & placing objects
			- Should mostly look like what it already does now
		- [ ] Select: Clicking will select furnis
			- Popup with actions should appear.
			- Actions: Rotate, move, pick up (adds back to inventory)
- [ ] Spike: Generate Furni Data AUTOMATICALLY from assets folder
	- We already have a strict sizing for spritesheets.
	- We already have strict naming for variations
	- Dynamically generate that on load!
- [ ] Wall objects should NOT be like regular Furniture.
	- Make them like Habbo
- [ ] Stacking
- [ ] Skybox support
- [ ] Beautiful windows effect sceneries!
- [ ] Furni tags & categories
- [ ] Player and interaction
  - Probably will need major refactor
- [ ] Floors & walls changing
	- [ ] Floor vs Floor furniture
- [ ] UI
- [ ] Multiplayer?
